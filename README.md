# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview

The purpose is to visualize bacterial data from volunteers by completing a dashboard, given a completed panel for demographic information. Specifically, volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. The dashboard can be found at this link: https://viernesr.github.io/Belly-Button-Biodiversity-Dashboard/
